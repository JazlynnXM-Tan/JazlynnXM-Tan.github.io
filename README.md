# Hello

I'm Jazlynn, a PhD student in Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto, co-supervised by [Dr. Maged Goubran](https://aiconslab.github.io/) and [Dr. Bojana Stefanovic](https://brainimaginglab.com/lab-overview). I employ a wide range of neurophysiological assays and machine learning to investigate the dysfunctional connectivity underlying cognitive impairment in traumatic brain injury (TBI) using mice models.

## Interests
Traumatic brain injury (TBI), cognitive behavioral testing, neuromodulation

## Skills
* Mice care and handling
* Cognitive testing using Bussey-Saksida touchscreen operant chambers for mice
* Electrophysiology using Neuropixels
* Lightsheet fluorescence microscopy
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
