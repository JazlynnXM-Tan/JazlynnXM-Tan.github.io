# Hello

I'm Jazlynn, a PhD student in Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto, co-supervised by [Dr. Maged Goubran](https://medbio.utoronto.ca/faculty/goubran) and [Dr. Bojana Stefanovic](https://medbio.utoronto.ca/faculty/stefanovic). I employ a wide range of neurophysiological assays and machine learning to investigate the dysfunctional connectivity underlying cognitive impairment in traumatic brain injury (TBI) using mice models.
