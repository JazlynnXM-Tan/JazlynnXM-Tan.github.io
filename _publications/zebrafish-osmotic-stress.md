title: "Osmotic Stress Uncovers Correlations and Dissociations Between Larval Zebrafish Anxiety Endophenotypes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/zebrafish-osmotic-stress
excerpt: 'This accompanies the [review paper](zebrafish-review). We show how osmotic stress can be used in several anxiety assays for larval zebrafish. We also introduce our tool, [EZGut](https://github.com/CarolineWeeLab/EZgut) which uses computer vision to segment the larval zebrafish gut in a high-throughput feeding assay. See more in [tweet](https://x.com/jazlynn_tan/status/1541260320487796737?t=peFtA8FYBUbAKN_CwwwNqA&s=19).'
